## Problem Statement
In late 2019 , the spread of the corona virus was limited to the Asias and only became a matter of gloabla precedence in February 2020. The spread of the disease has been managed by the imposition of different measures by different governments towards maintaining social distancing. In the implementing of these measures, it is important to find out which ones bear the most result in slowing down the infection rate and which measures could be done away with a change point analysis to quantify the impact of policy interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19


## Objective
For the week of 10th August , it is the goal of this project to find the possible number of infected persons given the different policies implemented.
The change points considered are :
-


## Tools and Methods used

1. The SIR model uses the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered rate where the susceptible population reduces as the number of those infected increase ( an inverse relationship). It can also be put forward that as the 
The model is based on the following assumptions:
    - The

2. PyMC3 - a standard Bayseian modelling package in Python. More information about the PyMC3 modelcan be found here : https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/api_quickstart.html

3. Bayesian Modelling & Inference: Bayesian models are founded on the Bayes theorem

In Bayesian inference, the event B is fixed in the discussion, and we wish to consider the impact of its having been observed on our belief in various possible events A. In such a situation the denominator of the last expression, the probability of the given evidence B, is fixed; what we want to vary is A. Bayes's theorem then shows that the posterior probabilities are proportional to the numerator
